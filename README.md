📊 README: Visualization Objective - Dog and Cat Identifier
🔎 Project Overview
The Dog and Cat Identifier is a deep learning-based image classification project. The model is trained to classify images as either Dog or Cat using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN).
To better understand model performance, data distribution, and learning behavior, multiple visualizations are used throughout the project.

🎯 Visualization Objectives
The visualizations serve multiple important goals:

1️⃣ Understand Dataset Distribution
Visualize the proportion of dog vs cat images.

Confirm dataset balance to avoid model bias.

Objective: Ensure equal representation of both classes for fair training.

2️⃣ Preview Sample Images
Display random samples of both dog and cat images.

Verify data quality and consistency.

Objective: Visually validate correctness of dataset labeling.

3️⃣ Model Performance Tracking
Plot Training vs Validation Accuracy over epochs.

Monitor learning behavior and potential overfitting.

Objective: Help decide if further tuning or regularization is needed.

4️⃣ Error Analysis via Confusion Matrix
Visualize correct and incorrect predictions.

Identify patterns of misclassification.

Objective: Understand where the model struggles (e.g. low-light images, similar breeds).

5️⃣ Data Preprocessing Verification
Visualize effects of image augmentation:

Flipping

Zooming

Shearing

Objective: Ensure proper data augmentation for robust model training.

🛠 Visualization Tools Used
Matplotlib — Plot accuracy and loss curves.

Seaborn — Generate confusion matrix heatmaps.

TensorBoard — (optional) Visualize training metrics interactively.

Custom Scripts — For dataset previews and augmentation checks.

🧪 Why Visualization is Critical
“You cannot improve what you cannot see.”

Visualizations help:

Debug data issues early.

Guide hyperparameter tuning.

Build confidence in the model’s learning process.

Communicate results clearly to stakeholders.
